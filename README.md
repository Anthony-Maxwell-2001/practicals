<!-- The background colour change, this comment, the <h2> heading & the <a href=""> link tag later on
was just to test the HTML and CSS passthrough for my own curiosity -->

## About me:

I really dislike writing about me sections, but I finished a certificate III in Information
Technology in 2018 and started JCU in 2021 doing a Bachelor in Information Technology.

## About this Repo:

This repo is a collection is all the weekly practicals I have done during CP1404 Programming II.

<h2>3 Things I have learnt about clean code:</h2>

- Clean code should follow standards set by the people who made the language.
- Clean code should have good naming, so any person who reads through your code should be able to work out what it does.
- Clean code that uses functions should have the functions only do 1 single thing, AKA Single Responsibility Principle.
